    <h2 class="steps-header">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="ol-list">
      <li>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes less than the package instructions, about 8 minutes. Drain pasta.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 13x9 inch baking dish.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook meatballs until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add marinara sauce and ricotta cheese; mix to combine. Add cooked pasta and mix to combine. Season with Italian seasoning and garlic powder.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Cover the bottom of the prepared baking dish with a layer of sauce without meatballs. Sprinkle 1 cup mozzarella cheese on top. Add another layer of sauce with meatballs on top and sprinkle with 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Add another layer of 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Add the rest of the sauce and meatball mixture on top, followed by remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove foil and bake until cheese starts to turn golden brown, 10 to 20 minutes. Enjoy!</p>
